abstract = { When a massive quantum body is put into a spatial superposition, it is of interest to consider the quantum aspects of the gravitational field sourced by the body. We argue that in order to understand how the body may become entangled with other massive bodies via gravitational interactions, it must be thought of as being entangled with its own Newtonian-like gravitational field. Thus, a Newtonian-like gravitational field must be capable of carrying quantum information. Our analysis supports the view that table-top experiments testing entanglement of systems interacting via gravity do probe the quantum nature of gravity, even if no “gravitons” are emitted during the experiment. }

abstract = {Gravity mediated entanglement (GME) has been proposed as the first experimentally testable signature of quantum gravity. However, to what extent the effect is due to quantum gravity is under debate. In this note, we argue in several ways that the observation of GME does indeed tell us something new about gravity compared to previous experiments. In particular, we consider a quantum reference frame treatment of the experiment that allows us to pinpoint the single degree of freedom responsible for the effect. We also discuss the relevance of the Newtonian limit, the longitudinal/transverse 9omposition of the field, and the local operations and classical communication theorem. Our conclusion is that experiments trying to detect GME would be interesting because (a) either positive or negative results would be able to falsify several theories (b) observation of GME would represent something truly novel.}

ABSTRACT={The Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment tests a quantum gravitational effect predicted by low energy perturbative quantum gravity. It has received attention because it may soon be within observational reach in the lab. We point out that: (i) in relativistic language, the experiment tests an interference effect between proper-time intervals; (ii) the feasibility study by Bose et al. suggests that current technology could allow to probe differences of such proper-time intervals of the order of 10<sup>−38</sup> seconds, about twenty orders of magnitude beyond the current resolution of the best atomic clocks; (iii) the difference of proper times approaches Planck time (10<sup>−44</sup> s) if the masses of the particles in the experiment approach the Planck mass (~micrograms). This implies that the experiment might open a window on the structure of time at the Planck scale. We show that if time differences are discrete at the Planck scale—as research in quantum gravity may suggest—the Planckian discreteness of time would appear as quantum levels of an in principle measurable entanglement entropy.}

abstract = {Two very similar proposals have been made recently for witnessing nonclassical features of gravity, by Bose et al and by Marletto and Vedral. However, while these proposals are asserted to be very general, they are in fact based on a very strong claim: that quantum systems cannot become entangled via a classical intermediary. We point out that the support provided for this claim is only applicable to a very limited class of quantum-classical interaction models, corresponding to Koopman-type dynamics. We show that the claim is also valid for mean-field models, but that it is contradicted by explicit counterexamples based on the configuration-ensemble model. Thus, neither proposal provides a definitive test of nonclassical gravity.}

abstract = {Einstein's special theory of relativity revolutionized physics by teaching us that space and time are not separate entities, but join as ‘spacetime’. His general theory of relativity further taught us that spacetime is not just a stage on which dynamics takes place, but is a participant: the field equation of general relativity connects matter dynamics to the curvature of spacetime. Curvature is responsible for gravity, carrying us beyond the Newtonian conception of gravity that had been in place for the previous two and a half centuries. Much research in gravitation since then has explored and clarified the consequences of this revolution; the notion of dynamical spacetime is now firmly established in the toolkit of modern physics. Indeed, this notion is so well established that we may now contemplate using spacetime as a tool for other sciences. One aspect of dynamical spacetime—its radiative character, ‘gravitational radiation’—will inaugurate entirely new techniques for observing violent astrophysical processes. Over the next 100 years, much of this subject's excitement will come from learning how to exploit spacetime as a tool for astronomy. This paper is intended as a tutorial in the basics of gravitational radiation physics.}
